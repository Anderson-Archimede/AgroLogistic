  {
    question: 'How long does it take to get a quote?',
    answer: 'Usually between 5 and 7 business days. The quotation process starts with a meeting and a project analysis, which helps us better understand your goals and requirements. Once the analysis is approved, we prepare a detailed estimate and proposed project timeline.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does project delivery take?',
    answer: 'It depends on the complexity - from a few weeks for smaller projects to several months for large-scale systems. At the start of our collaboration, we define a clear timeline and milestones so the entire process is transparent to you.'
  },
  {
    question: 'I need to share some data to help you understand my needs. Is it safe?',
    answer: 'Yes. In such cases, we sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) before any data is shared. This ensures all information about your project and company remains fully secure.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I start with a smaller scope, like an MVP?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. Many of our collaborations begin with an MVP, allowing you to quickly validate your idea and start generating revenue. In later stages, we expand the solution based on user feedback, needs, and budget.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What types of companies do you usually work with?',
    answer: 'We collaborate with a wide range of businesses, most often: E-commerce companies (online stores, furniture manufacturers, 3D product configurators), EdTech organizations and companies (e-learning platforms, language schools), Companies implementing AI solutions (process automation, data analysis). We work with both SMEs and large enterprises in Poland and abroad.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What do you specialize in?',
    answer: 'We specialize in building custom web solutions for business, especially: Product configurators for e-commerce, E-learning and LMS platforms (EdTech), AI-powered solutions that automate business processes. With 15 years of experience and proprietary tools, we reduce project delivery time by up to several dozen percent.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need a fully developed project idea?',
    answer: 'Not necessarily. Many of our clients come to us with a concept rather than a full specification. During the collaboration, we help refine the vision and choose optimal solutions through our Product Discovery Workshop.'
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide post-launch support?',
    answer: 'Yes. We offer ongoing technical maintenance and system development after launch. This ensures your solution stays stable and evolves along with your business needs.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What does your collaboration process look like?',
    answer: '1. Meeting and needs analysis. 2. Quote and timeline preparation. 3. Agreement and project kick-off. 4. Regular sprints and testing. 5. Deployment and post-launch support. Each stage is fully transparent - you have continuous access to progress and direct contact with our project team.'
